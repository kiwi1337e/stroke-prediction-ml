# Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Stroke is one of the leading causes of serious long-term disability and death worldwide.
Early detection of individuals at high risk of stroke allows doctors to intervene earlier and potentially save lives.

Goal: Build a machine learning model to predict whether a person is likely to suffer a stroke based on their health and lifestyle features.
Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

ðŸŽ¯ What the Model Predicts
The model predicts whether a patient is at high risk (1) or low risk (0) of stroke,
based on medical, demographic, and lifestyle factors.

ðŸ›  How It Works
1.Data Loading â†’ Import dataset into pandas DataFrame

2.Data Cleaning â†’ Handle missing values (e.g., fill BMI with mean), drop irrelevant columns (id)

3.Encoding â†’ Convert categorical columns to numeric form (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding)

4.Feature Selection â†’

X = All columns except id & stroke

y = stroke column

5.Train-Test Split â†’ Split dataset into 80% train, 20% test

6.Model Training â†’ Random Forest Classifier (can be replaced with XGBoost)

7.Evaluation â†’ Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stroke-prediction.git
cd stroke-prediction
2. Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Train the model:python train_model.py

ðŸ“Š Future Improvements
Balance dataset to reduce bias (e.g., SMOTE oversampling).

Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.

Try other models like XGBoost, LightGBM.

Deploy using Streamlit or Flask for real-time predictions.
